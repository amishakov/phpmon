     You can pass in which PHP versions need to be upgraded and which ones need to be installed.
     The process will be executed in two steps: first upgrades, then installations.
     
     Upgrades come first because... well, otherwise installations may very well break.
     Each version that is installed will need to be checked afterwards. Installing a
     newer formula may break other PHP installations, which in turn need to be fixed.

     - Important: If any PHP formula is a major upgrade that causes a PHP "version" to be
       uninstalled, this is remedied by running `upgradeMainPhpFormula()`. This process
       will ensure that the upgrade is applied, but the also that old version is
       re-installed and linked again.

    // Ensure that the events are broadcast within 24 hrs since launch OR when the app quits
    // If the events are broadcast after 24 hrs of the app being running, reset analytics
    // Alternatively, batch events and dispatch them every hour (and keep track of what was sent)
    // I will think about this some more, these are just ideas for now
